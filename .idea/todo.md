## TODOs

- ~~On mobile, change the product filter dropdown
to use percentage-based widths instead of fixed
pixel~~
    - This may not actually be necessary, pending
    testing on very small screen widths. An
    alternative would be using media queries
    that are based on the height of the current
    display.
    - Going to leave this for now until test case proves otherwise.
    
- ~~On mobile, change the navigation to be a dropdown
similar to the product filter (with fixed positioning)~~

- Add the product quantity select box to individual
product pages

- Style individual product pages to fit
look and feel of the rest of the site
- Style the product filter sidebar to be consistent
and not load styling via JavaScript after
the page has loaded
- Style product filter sidebar to be consistent with
parent/child styling as shown on
GCFerrules.com
- Fix the FAQs page so that the dropdowns actually
work (and maybe completely remove the dropdowns?)
- Implement color scheme determined by graphic
designer that RS uses for their logos
- Pay for hosting, change DNS servers to point
to hosting
- Put site up in production
- Link up actual payment gateway
- Run production tests

## MAYBEs

- Filter products via AJAX
- Add fixed positioning for sidebar on products page
    - If this happened, then we would need to keep
    the sidebar in the same place until the user 
    scrolled down past the fold; only at that
    point would it move fixed
- Add products to cart via AJAX
- Add a form to the Contact Us page
