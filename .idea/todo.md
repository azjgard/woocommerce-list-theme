## TODOs

- ~~On mobile, change the product filter dropdown
to use percentage-based widths instead of fixed
pixel~~
    - This may not actually be necessary, pending
    testing on very small screen widths. An
    alternative would be using media queries
    that are based on the height of the current
    display.
    - Going to leave this for now until test case proves otherwise.
    
- ~~On mobile, change the navigation to be a dropdown
similar to the product filter (with fixed positioning)~~

- Add the product quantity select box to individual
product pages

- Style individual product pages to fit
look and feel of the rest of the site

- Style the product filter sidebar to be consistent
and not load styling via JavaScript after
the page has loaded

- Style product filter sidebar to be consistent with
parent/child styling as shown on
GCFerrules.com

- Fix the FAQs page so that the dropdowns actually
work (and maybe completely remove the dropdowns?)

- Implement color scheme determined by graphic
designer that RS uses for their logos

- Optimize speed and load times

- Pay for hosting, change DNS servers to point
to hosting

- Put site up in production


- Link up actual payment gateway

- Run production tests

## MAYBEs

- Filter products via AJAX
- ~~Add fixed positioning for sidebar on products page~~
- Add products to cart via AJAX
- Add a form to the Contact Us page
